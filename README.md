# Week4_Assignment
This project analyzes the relationship between student study time and exam scores using basic Statistics & Probability techniques commonly applied in Data Science. The goal is to determine whether study time has a significant impact on academic performance.

📂 Dataset - student_scores.csv
Columns:
Hours – Number of hours studied
Scores – Exam score obtained
Observations: 11 students

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Simple Linear Regression

📊 Key Results

Correlation Coefficient (r): 0.981
p-value: 1.0 × 10⁻⁷
Strong positive and statistically significant relationship between study hours and exam scores.

📌 Hypothesis Testing

Null Hypothesis (H₀): Study time does not significantly affect exam scores
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Study time significantly affects exam scores
Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.
